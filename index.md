# First Milestone :)
  
My first milestone was setting up the base for my project. Firstly, I set up my raspberry pi and connected it to my monitor. Then, I set up the raspberrypi to raspi in order to ping my IP address. After, I got SSH, VNC, and Visual studio for my code and connected that to my SSH. This step was neccessary because it allowes me to make or chanage any code I need fof my project. Lastly, I installed Magic Mirror, which is a Node JS Application. Magic Mirror assisterd in generating the base I need for my project. With it, I can chan ge or add codes to make my smart mirror suitable for me.
