# Third Milestone üòÉ
In summary, I downlaoded rasperrypi onto my computer. Then, I connected my raspberry pi to my monitor. After, I created a SSH file so I can download Magic Mirror. Then, I installed Magic Mirror onto my VS appplication. Once the base was completed, I made a few customizations to my project such ass adding compliments, adding the weather forecast, and changing the colors for the calendar, weather icons, and some of the text.

# Second Milestone üòÑ
My second Milestone was customizing Magic Mirror. First, I added effects for my alerts. Then, I decided to change the color for my calendar. After, I  added compliments to my project. The compliments I added were based on the date, time, and weather. For instance, when it's morning, my mirror will greet me with a good morning message. Additonally, when it's raining, my mirror will message be to be safe during rainy weather. I added the weather forescast in order for my weather compliments to work. When adding the weather, I added my location and changed the weather from celsius to fahrenheit. Also, I added colors for weather icons and changed the color to a light color purple in the main css.file

# First Milestone üòÅ
My first milestone was setting up the base for my project. First, I set up my raspberry pi and connected it to my monitor. Then, I pinged my IP address. After, I got a coding apllication called Visual Studio to create a SSH file for my project. Lastly, I installed Magic Mirror, which is a Node JS Application. Magic Mirror assisted in generating the base I need for my project. With it, I can chan ge or add codes to make my smart mirror suitable for me.
