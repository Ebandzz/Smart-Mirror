# Second Milestone 
My second Milestone was customizing Magic Mirror. First, I added effects for my alerts. Then, I decided to chanhge the color for my calendar. After, I  added compliments to my project. The compliments I added were based on specific dates, time, and weather. For instance, when it's morning, my mirror will greet me with a good morning message. Additonally, when it's raining, my mirror will message be to be safe during rainy weather. I added the weather forescast in order for my weather compliments to work. When adding the weather, I added my location and changed the weather form celsius to fahrenheit. Also, I added colors for weather icons and changed the color to a light color purple in the main css.file

# First Milestone :)
  
My first milestone was setting up the base for my project. Firstly, I set up my raspberry pi and connected it to my monitor. Then, I set up the raspberrypi to raspi in order to ping my IP address. After, I got SSH, VNC, and Visual studio for my code and connected that to my SSH. This step was neccessary because it allowes me to make or chanage any code I need fof my project. Lastly, I installed Magic Mirror, which is a Node JS Application. Magic Mirror assisterd in generating the base I need for my project. With it, I can chan ge or add codes to make my smart mirror suitable for me.
