This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first n=milestone was setting up the base for my project. Firstly, I set up my raspberry pi and conne3cted it to my monitor. Then, I set up the raspberrypi to raspi in order to ping my IP address. After, I got SSH, VNC, and Visual studio for my code and connected that to SSH. This step was neccessary because it allowes me to make or chanage any code I need fofr my project. Lastly, I installed Magic Mirror, which is a Node JS Application. Magic Mirror assisterd in generating the base I need for my project. With it, I can chan ge or add codes to make my smart mirror suitable for me.
